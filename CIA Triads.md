The CIA Triad is a concept of information security. It tells us how data should be protected so that it remains safe and useful. The CIA Triad is a framework in information security that helps organizations protect data and maintain secure, reliable systems. CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Confidentiality** 
Confidentiality means protecting information from unauthorized access. Only people who are allowed should be able to see or use the data. This is important for sensitive information such as passwords, personal details, bank records . Confidentiality is maintained using methods like passwords, encryption, user authentication, and access control. If confidentiality is not maintained, data can be leaked or misused.

**Integrity** 
Integrity means ensuring that the data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered. Information should not be changed, deleted, or modified by unauthorized users. Information like student marks, medical records, or financial data must stay correct. If integrity is lost, wrong or fake information may be stored, leading to loss of credentiability as well.

**Availability**
Availability means that the users authorized to access should be able to access information whenever they need it. Systems, networks, and data should work properly without frequent breakdowns. Availability is ensured by using backup systems, regular maintenance, antivirus software. If availability is affected, users may not be able to access important services at the required time.
