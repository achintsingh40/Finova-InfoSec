# Encryption vs Encoding 
Encryption means locking data so that only authorized people can read it while Encoding means changing data into another format so it can be easily stored or transmitted. They both change data but are used for very different purposes. When data is encrypted, it is locked using a secret key so that only authorized people can read it. For example when you enter your password on a banking website, it is encrypted before being sent over the internet. Even if a hacker intercepts it, they cannot understand it without the key. This is commonly used for passwords, bank details, and private messages. Unlike encryption,  encoding isn’t about but rather it changes the data into another format so it can be stored of easily stored or shared between platforms. For example, images or text are often encoded in Base64 so they can be sent through emails or websites properly. Anyone can decode encoded data, so it does not provide security.

# The Principle of Least Privilege
The Principle of Least Privilege means giving users only the access they actually need and nothing more. This helps keep systems safe and prevents misuse. For example, in a company, an intern may be allowed to view documents but not edit or delete them: or a cashier in a store can generate bills but cannot access the company’s bank accounts. By limiting access, mistakes and security breaches can be controlled. Even if a user’s account is hacked, the attacker cannot cause major damage because the permissions are restricted. This principle plays a key role in maintaining security and trust in systems.
